**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](02-acr.md)

## Introduction

A smart cloud solution architect always has the right tools in their toolbox. 

## Description

In this challenge we'll be validating that we have all the tools we will need to complete our challenges.

### Local tooling
- Install the recommended toolset: (assumes Windows)
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux
    - Azure CLI
    - Kubectl (kubernetes CLI)
    - Visual Studio Code.  Recommended extensions:
      - [Azure Account](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account)
      - [Kubernetes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools)
- These tools could also be run on MacOs, or alternatively, you could use the Azure Cloud Shell

### Azure

You will need an Azure Subscription to run these exercises.  Confirm with your coach that you have appropriate access to an Azure Subscription.

### Code Sharing

While not 100% required, it is highly recommended that the team set up a repo to share code, manifests, snippets, etc.  Feel free to use your preferred source code control system:  GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.


## Success Criteria

1. You have a bash shell at your disposal (WSL, Mac, Linux or Azure Cloud Shell)
1. Running `az --version` shows the version of your Azure CLI
1. Visual Studio Code is installed.
2. Everyone on the team is enabled as a co-owner on the appropriate Azure Subscription
